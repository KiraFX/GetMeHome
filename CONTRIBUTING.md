# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the code or translation, just fork, clone,
commit, then PR it.

## Formatting

* `YAML` files should be indented with two spaces.
* `Java` files should be indented with four spaces (no tabs).

If there's tabs in an acceptable PR, I will replace tabs with spaces.

## Translation

All translations should go in the `src/main/resources/` directory, and be named
`GetMeHome_xx_YY.properties` where `xx` is the language code and `YY` is the
country code.

Get started with translation by making a copy of `GetMeHome.properties` and
rename it for the destination locale.

# Issues/Feature Request

When you want any feature request, you may open an issue about it.

If there's enough interest, an API can be developed.
