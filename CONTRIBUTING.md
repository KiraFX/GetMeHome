# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the code or translation, just fork, clone,
commit, then PR it!

## Formatting

* `YAML` files should be indented with two spaces.
* `Java` files should be indented with four spaces (no tabs).

Try to follow these indentation rules. I will still accept PR with different
styling, but that would mean I need to fix it in the end~

## Translation

All translations should go in the `src/main/resources/i18n/` directory, and be
named `GetMeHome_xx_YY.properties` where `xx` is the language code and `YY` is
the country code. So far, the only exception is Shakespearean English, which is
just "enws" with no underscores.

Get started with translation by making a copy of `GetMeHome.properties` and
rename it for the destination locale!

# Issues/Feature Request

When you want any feature request or encounter any bugs, you may open an issue
about it.

If there's enough interest, an API can be developed.
