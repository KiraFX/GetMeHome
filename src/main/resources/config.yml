# Localization
localization:
#

# Use {0} in place of home name(s).
# Most of these should be self-explanatory.
    TAG: "[GetMeHome]"
    HOME: "Welcome to your {0} home."
    SET: "{0} is now set."
    DELETE: "{0} has been deleted."
    DNE: "{0} does not exist."
    LIST: "Your homes: {0}"
    LIMIT_REACHED: "You are at your limit."

###
# Home Limits
limit:
#

# default - default home limit. 1 means only home named "default"
#           is allowed.  This must be on top. (leave it here)
    default: 1
# The checking priority goes from top to bottom (excluding default).
#   If a person has two or more permission groups in the list below,
#   the top-most node will have priority.
# The rest of the home limit can be listed in this format:
#   permission.node: maximum number of homes
# example:
    gmh.twohomes: 2
