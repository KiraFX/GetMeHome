#             "default" is allowed.
    default: 1
# The rest of the home limit can be listed as permission nodes.
# The priority goes from top to bottom.  If a person has more than
#   one permission groups below, the top-most node will have
#   a priority.  The rest of the list can be written as:
# permission.node: maximum number of homes
